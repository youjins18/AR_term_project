# chr_description

`chr` means **cone harvest robot**: a four-tilting-rotor Palletrone with the
three-command-coordinate harvesting arm rigidly attached to its underside.

## Model composition

- `scene.xml`: visualization defaults and the complete scene entry point.
- `chr.xml`: physics options, assets, actuators and composition root.
- `palletrone.xml`: free base, four diagonal tilt joints, rotor sites, CAD visuals
  and lightweight primitive collision geometry.
- `arm.xml`: original cone harvester CAD, inertial data and joints J1--J3. The
  original fourth wrist joint is intentionally fixed because the requested CHR
  command vector contains three arm coordinates.

The Palletrone `BODY.stl` and `PROP.stl` meshes retain the original TPAM metre
scale and X-configuration transforms. All arm meshes are copied without geometric
modification from `cone_harvester_sim`. The attachment transform is the
`arm_mount` body in `chr.xml`; it is currently `(-0.10, 0, -0.13) m` in the
Palletrone body frame, so the arm is shifted 10 cm along body -X and remains
immediately below the BODY mesh. When this transform changes, update the matching
fixed transform in `chr_controller/src/chr_dynamics_library.cpp` so DLS-IK and
MuJoCo use identical kinematics.

The visible robot palette is black structure, white printed/housing parts and
orange propellers/TCP. The desired TCP marker is a blue position sphere plus an
arrow along the desired TCP frame's local +Z axis.

Frames use MuJoCo conventions: right-handed world with +Z up, free-body
quaternion `(w,x,y,z)`, positions in metres, angles in radians, forces in newtons.
